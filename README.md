# MERN Stack Template

## Overview

This repository provides a ready-to-deploy MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack template. It streamlines the setup process, allowing developers to quickly get started on their projects with minimal configuration. This template is ideal for building full-stack web applications.

## Features

- **Fast Setup**: Quickly deploy your application with minimal configuration.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with modern UI practices in mind.
- **RESTful API**: Easily create and manage backend endpoints.
- **User Authentication**: Includes basic user authentication using JWT.
- **CRUD Operations**: Preconfigured for create, read, update, and delete functionalities.
- **Environment Variables**: Support for managing configurations via `.env` files.
- **Deployment Ready**: Optimized for deployment on platforms like Heroku, Vercel, or DigitalOcean.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Axios, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MongoDB (local installation or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
- Git

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/monanksojitra/MERN-Stack-Template.git
   cd mere-stack-template
   ```
````

2. **Install Dependencies**

   - For the backend:

     ```bash
     cd server
     npm install
     ```

   - For the frontend:
     ```bash
     cd ../client
     npm install
     ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and configure your MongoDB URI and JWT secret.

   ```plaintext
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   - Start the backend server:

     ```bash
     cd server
     npm run dev
     ```

   - Start the frontend:
     ```bash
     cd ../client
     npm start
     ```

5. **Access the Application**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend.

## User Cases

### 1. User Registration

Users can register by providing their email and password. The application will validate the input and store the user information securely.

### 2. User Login

Users can log in using their registered credentials. Upon successful login, a JWT token is issued, allowing access to protected routes.

### 3. Data Management

Users can perform CRUD operations on resources (e.g., posts, comments) directly from the frontend, which communicates with the backend API.

### 4. Admin Features

An admin user can manage other users and their permissions via a dedicated admin panel.

## Deployment

This template is optimized for deployment. You can deploy the backend on Heroku and the frontend on Vercel or Netlify. Follow the respective platform's documentation for deployment steps.
